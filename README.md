# Online-Class-Helper-for-Windows
Attend online classes with one click!

OCH - Online Class Helper is a tool made for students attending online classes which allows them to join and attend their classes hassle-free with a single click. Unable to organize all your class links throughout your week? Add your classes once they're organized and tabulated. You can also make and share templates with your friends which can save them time.

# Features
- Organized Classes

- Easily add, edit or delete classes

- Make, share and load templates

# Installation
- Turn off your Antivirus softwares before trying to setup OCH since .exe files without EV code signatures can be triggered by antivirus softwares as malware/trojan. However, you don't have to worry about any harm to your computer because this is only a false positive that triggers the AVs. Make sure you add the .exe file as an exception in your AVs to avoid abrupt deletion of the file by your AVs. You can turn your AVs back on as soon as you've added it as an exception. 
(The setup .exe file has been detected only by 2 AVs out of 68 on VirusTotal and it's a common issue with converting files using Pyinstaller. It's the fault of the AV vendors for their inaccuracy of malware/trojan detection)

- Download and run the OCH_setup.exe file.

- Set up your classes by going to the Add/Edit classes tab. You can also load a .dat/.txt template using the 'load file' button. So you can make and share templates of your classes with each other! 

  Note: Manually modified files won't work as they should be binary files and must be generated through OCH.

- You're done! Head back to the main page and you will find your class details at the corresponding time. Good luck, and happy learning!

# Note
Do not modify/delete any of the files in the root directory or it will result in the malfunctioning or improper loading of the program
